\caption{Human (expert) evaluation on 200 permuted examples from the MNLI matched development set. Half of the permuted pairs contained shorter sentences and the other, longer ones. %Experts were provided only the permuted sentences (not the original example or the label) and were disallowed from consulting with one another. 
All permuted examples were assigned the gold label by RoBERTa-Large. %crowd$^*$ was crowdworker accuracy measured by \newcite{gupta-etal-2021-bert} on the GLUE Benchmark.
